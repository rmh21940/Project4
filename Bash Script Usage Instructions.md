### a. Using USB

1. Copy the script file to a USB drive.
2. Insert the USB into the Raspberry Pi.
3. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cp /media/pi/<USB_DRIVE_NAME>/raspberry_pi_kiosk_auto_setup.sh ~/
```

### b. Using SCP from Another Computer

On your other device, run:

```bash
scp raspberry_pi_kiosk_auto_setup.sh pi@<RPI-IP>:/home/pi/
```

## Step 2: Make the Script Executable

Open a terminal on the Raspberry Pi and run:

```bash
chmod +x raspberry_pi_kiosk_auto_setup.sh
```

---

## â–¶Step 3: Run the Script

Run the script:

```bash
./raspberry_pi_kiosk_auto_setup.sh
```

The script will:
- Update and upgrade your system
- Install Apache, MariaDB, and PHP
- Clone the project repository
- Deploy the front-end code
- Configure the database
- Enable necessary services on boot
- Set Chromium to launch the login page in kiosk mode on boot

## Optional: Log Script Output

To save the output to a log file for troubleshooting or review:

```bash
./raspberry_pi_kiosk_auto_setup.sh | tee setup_log.txt
```

## Post-Run

After the script completes and the Raspberry Pi reboots, it will automatically launch the login page in Chromium. Your kiosk is now ready for use.

You can now capture this SD card as a `.img` file to distribute to clients.
